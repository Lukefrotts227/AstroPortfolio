# AstroPortfolio
My Portfolio Website built with Astro

# may start by simply porting over the old react portfolio
For now I need to get rid of the pointless javascript code that could be replaced with media css


# Why?
I will be shifting over to astro as it is an ideal frame for more content focused websites such as a portfolio.
